My solution for QA automation test, tested on windows machine you should need only jdk1.8.0._111 at C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_111
and you're good to go.

My next step would be trying out Selenide. It was nice exercise overall, I've used things that I haven't used for a long time 
and I'd like to hear what I did wrong or what could be done better, never mind if this left good or bad impression.
